# Concurrent and Distributed Systems

## Processes
A process the the representation of a **program** in execution (code + variables + CPU access).

Running processes in parallel (**multitasking**) makes the resources more reusable (virtual memory, CPU cycles management).

### Process Life-cycle

// process lifecycle picture/diagram

**Context switching** allows to share the resources between the OS and the various processes by using interrupts.

When the process finishes it asks the OS to free the allocated resources.
